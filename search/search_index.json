Web3Gate is a completely functional BaaS software that is extremely secure, intuitive, and smart. It has a crypto payment API for native (such as BTC, ETH, MATIC, BNB, CRO, ONE, FTM, AVAX, etc.) and ERC20 tokens that users can integrate into their website/web application to create and receive crypto payments for their products or services, using Metamask wallet or other web3 wallets for completing transactions, with the ability for users to add their ERC20 token to their payment option. It also has a decentralized multi-chain launchpad system that allows users to create a staking pool for their token and can manage the staking progress and stakes of the pool. Web3Gate is developed with the PHP programming language and Laravel 9 MVC framework - the most widely used PHP MVC framework.
